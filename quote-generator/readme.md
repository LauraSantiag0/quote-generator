# Make a Quote Generator

In this folder you will find the basic setup of a quote generator.

You can change any of the files in this project.

First off, once you've branched off `main`, then update the title element in `index.html` to "Quote generator app"

## How the Quote Generator should work

When the page loads it should show a random quote from the `quotes` array on the screen. It should also show who said the quote.

When you click a button on the screen it should change the quote on the screen.

It can look however you like but there is an example in this folder at `quote_generator_example.png`

## Need Help?

- If you can't work out how to find a random element from the array, either:
  - (advanced) try to use `Math.random()`
  - OR
  - (basic) use the `pickFromArray()` function supplied in the javascript file.

## Stretch

Only attempt the stretch once you've attempted the other sections.

### Add auto-play to your quote generator

For this task you will return to your quote generator and improve it with "auto-generate" functionality:

- Add a toggle-switch or checkbox input to your existing quote generator.
- When the switch is ON:
  - ... the generator should pick and display a new quote every 60 seconds. (When testing you will probably want to reduce this to every 5 seconds.)
  - ... the generator should display "auto-play:ON" somewhere on the page.
- When the switch is OFF
  - ... the generator should NOT change quote automatically
